		Functions
			Functions
				One input to one output
					We can reuse the "vending machine" from previous versions. Press a button, get an output.
					An interactive visual function map, drawing arrows from set A to set B. User can move elements and map element to element. Only allow each element to map to one other element.
					Another interactive map. This time elements are mapped to multiple. Explain why this is not a function.
				Horizontal tables
					Horizontal table with mutable elements and headers. Caption can say "this table depicts f as a function of x, its domain..."
					Similar but the table is not a function. Encourage user to make it a function.
				Vertical tables
					Vertical table with mutable elements and headers. Caption can say "this table depicts f as a function of x, its domain..."
					Similar but the table is not a function. Encourage user to make it a function.
				Multiple functions in a table
					Horizontal table with multiple function values
					Vertical table with multiple function values
				Functions as formulas
					
				The cartesian plane
					
				Value of a graph
					
				When is a graph not a function? / Vertical line test
					
				Multiple functions on a graph

				Functions as words

					
			Domain & Range
				Sets
				Intervals
				Unions & Intersections
				Domain & range of a table
				Domain & range of a graph
				Domain & range of a formula
				Domain & range of words
			Linear Functions
			Increasing & Decreasing Functions
			Practice
					Draw a table with multiple outputs, some of which repeat. Ask the user to correct it so it only depicts functions.
